    <p>We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. This should be interesting. Computer, lights up! Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? You enjoyed that. Your shields were failing, sir. They were just sucked into space. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers.
